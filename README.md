Data Science Project: Average Income by Gender
This is a simple data science project that uses pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to load, clean, and visualize a dataset of income data by gender. The project consists of a single Python script (average_income_by_gender.py) that loads the data from a CSV file, cleans the data by replacing missing values with the mean of the column, calculates the average income by gender using the groupby function, and plots a bar chart of the results using the plot function of the pandas DataFrame.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.6 or higher
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Usage
To run the project, simply run the average_income_by_gender.py script using Python:
python average_income_by_gender.py


The script will load the data from the data.csv file in the same directory, clean the data, calculate the average income by gender, and plot a bar chart of the results.
